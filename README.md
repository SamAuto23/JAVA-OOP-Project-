# Java OOP Project

This project was developed as part of my **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** coursework at **Loughborough University**.  
It demonstrates key OOP principles — **encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction** — through a practical Java application built using the Eclipse IDE.

---

## 🚀 Overview
This project implements a Java Object-Oriented Shopping System that models the structure and interactions of a real-world e-commerce platform.

The system allows users to browse products, add items to a shopping basket, and complete purchases using various payment methods.

Key entities include Users, Products, Shopping Baskets, Orders, and Payment types (e.g. PayPal and CreditCard). Each class demonstrates object-oriented principles such as inheritance, abstraction, and polymorphism.

For example, Product serves as a base class extended by specialised product types like Mouse and Keyboard, while the Payment class is abstract, implemented by concrete payment subclasses.

The system design emphasises modularity, data encapsulation, and reusability, enabling easy maintenance and scalability for future extensions (e.g. adding new product categories or payment methods).

## 🧩 Key Features
- ✅ Designed using **OOP principles** (Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Abstraction)
- ✅ Implements **modular classes** and reusable methods
- ✅ Demonstrates **error handling** and **input validation**
- ✅ Includes **file handling** for data persistence (if applicable)
- ✅ Clear **console-based or GUI-based** interface (depending on your implementation)
- ✅ Fully tested and documented in Java

- **Paradigm:** Object-Oriented Programming  
- **Version Control:** Git & GitHub

## 📚 OOP Concepts Demonstrated
| Concept | Implementation Example |
|----------|------------------------|
| **Encapsulation** | Private fields with public getters/setters |
| **Inheritance** | Parent and child classes sharing methods |
| **Polymorphism** | Method overriding and dynamic dispatch |
| **Abstraction** | Use of abstract classes or interfaces |
